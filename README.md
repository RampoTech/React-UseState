# React Background Color Change App

## Description

This is a simple React application that demonstrates how to use the `useState` hook to dynamically change the background color of the app. The app provides a button that, when clicked, cycles through a list of colors and applies them as the background color of the page. It is a great way to get started with React and understand how state and event handling work.
